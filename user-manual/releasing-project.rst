Releasing project
=================

This chapter follows up on chapters :ref:`chapter-2` or
:ref:`chapter-3` and represents last steps of project publishing. If
the traditional way was followed, display user's project page and
click on the project name (blue colour).  If user went through the
experimental way, text below continues directly to chapter
:ref:`chapter-4`.

Section called ``SETTINGS`` is displayed. There are few
options in the settings window. It is possible to load map canvas using
map button (``1``). Use delete button (``2``) in case of removing whole project.
For logging out find the top right button (``3``).
Furthermore, it is possible to change the project title (``4``), set the
rate of autenthication (``5``) or edit map extent setting (``6``). There are few
possibilities how to edit map extent (``7``). First of all is to fill in the
desired coordinates into the frames. Secondly, map extent can be edited
manually by drawing a delimiting rectangle area in map. Last option is to
use extent of one imported layer or extent of all of them.
Setting map scales is possible in the left box (``8``). Executed changes are
reflected in map preview (``9``).

   Couple of ways how to set map extent.

Check the subsection Layers for advanced adjustment of layers. The base layer
can be chosen in the left box (a blank base map is default). Within the right
box it is possible to specify which layers will be published or hidden (or both
which means that the layer will be published but turned off when the project is opened).
