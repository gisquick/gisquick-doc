Dear user, welcome to **Gisquick** documentation!
Gisquick (http://gisquick.org) is an open-source geospatial data platform for publishing geospatial data in terms of rapid
sharing `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ projects. Explore more to see how easy yet powerful is working in Gisquick.

There are a few topics you might be interested in. Firstly, if you want to **publish** your **QGIS**
**project online**, see sections :ref:`chapter-1` and :ref:`chapter-2`.


If you wonder what are the features of a **published web map** and **how to set them**,
check sections :ref:`chapter-3` and :ref:`chapter-4`.
Browse section :ref:`chapter-5` for **metadata of example datasets** that were used for documentation. If you plan to
**operate Gisquick publication server** on your own device, see section :ref:`chapter-6`.

.. note::
   
   This documentation is dedicated to Gisquick version 3. For older documentation visit https://gisquick.rtfd.io/en/release-1_x/ and https://gisquick.rtfd.io/en/release-2_x/.
