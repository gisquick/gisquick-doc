Introduction

Dear user, welcome to **Gisquick** documentation!
Gisquick (http://gisquick.org) is an open-source geospatial data platform for publishing geospatial data in terms of rapid
sharing `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ projects. Explore more to see how easy yet powerful is working in Gisquick.

There are a few topics you might be interested in. Firstly, if you are about to **publish** your **QGIS**
**project online**, see chapter :ref:`chapter-1` to :ref:`chapter-3`. Together with every released project,
web map service (**WMS**) is created and can be subsequently modified.

If you wonder **what does the output look like** or **which features are involved**, check chapter :ref:`chapter-4`.
Browse chapter :ref:`chapter-5` for **metadata of example datasets** which were used for documentation. If you plan to
**operate Gisquick publication server** on your own hardware, see chapter :ref:`chapter-6`.

.. note::
   
   This documentation is dedicated to Gisquick version 2. For older documentation visit https://gisquick.rtfd.io/en/release-1_x/.

   a new independent project usable with or without GIS.lab
   infrastructure.
