This chapter follows up on chapter :ref:`chapter-2` and represents last steps of project publishing. 

A section called ``SETTINGS`` is displayed. There are a few
options in the settings window. It is possible to load map canvas using the
map button (``1``). Use the delete button (``2``) in case of removing the whole project.
For logging out find the top right button (``3``).
Furthermore, it is possible to change the project title (``4``), set the
rate of authentication (``5``) or edit map extent setting (``6``). There are few
possibilities how to edit map extent (``7``). The first is to fill in the
desired coordinates into the frames. The second possibility, the map extent can be edited
manually by drawing a delimiting rectangle area ina  map. The last option is to
use the extent of one imported layer or extent of all of them.
Setting map scales is possible in the left box (``8``). Executed changes are
reflected in map preview (``9``).

   Couple of ways how to set map extent.

Check the subsection Layers for advanced adjustment of layers. The base layer
can be chosen in the left box (a blank base map is default). Within the right
box, it is possible to specify which layers will be published or hidden (or both
which means that the layer will be published but turned off when the project is opened).
