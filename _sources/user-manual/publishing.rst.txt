Preparing project
-----------------
Firstly, click on ``Publish`` button which is situated next to the
``Upload`` button in the user's project page. It allows publishing a project
directly from QGIS. In order to publish a project, the QGIS plugin needs to be
installed and connected. The required plugin is available to download for 64-bit OS
(Windows, Linux, Darwin).

   Where to download plugin for direct publishing from QGIS.

Once the download is complete, open QGIS and find tab ``Plugins`` and
choose ``Manage and install plugins``. Continue to the ``Install from
zip`` tab, set path to the downloaded zip file and hit the install button.

   How to proceed in QGIS to install the experimental plugin.

When the installation is finished, it is possible to check new acquisition
in the list of installed plugins. Also, a new icon appears in QGIS toolbar.
Next step is to prepare the project in QGIS.

Save the project before the next step.

.. important:: |imp| When using flat files or file-based databases as
   data stores it is highly recommended to save all the files (data and QGIS
   project) in the same directory or its subdirectory. QGIS project must be
   set up to use **relative** paths (see *Project Properties*). An
   error warning appears otherwise (see figure below).
   
   When using any kind of authentication (databases, web services) it
   must be ensured that the server used for publishing will have access
   rights to such data sources.

.. _uploading-project:

Uploading project
-----------------

Once the project is ready, click on Gisquick plugin logo.
For the very first time, Gisquick asks the user to fill in the connection
and Gisquick login details.

   Example of filled connection and login details.

After succesful check-in to the Gisquick server, the project is screened
in user's experimental publish window. Notice, that the Gisquick 2
icon stays active in QGIS until the user clicks on it again and interrupts the
connection with the server.

   Successful check-in to the Gisquick server and loaded sample project.

The first section called ``CHECK-IN`` consists of two tabs and represents
an overview which is designed to easily check on loaded layers. It is not
possible to make any changes within these tabs. Eventual corrections
could be made back in QGIS.

First tab ``General`` includes some fundamental information about user's
project, e.g. map projection, units, predefined scales or print templates.
Second tab ``Layers`` contains a list of layers with additional information.

When the project is checked and ready, proceed to the ``Upload`` section.
Two windows will split the screen: local project files are listed in the left,
intended server folder appears in the right one. Click on ``UPLOAD FILES`` button.

   Upload section displays local files and intended server folder.
