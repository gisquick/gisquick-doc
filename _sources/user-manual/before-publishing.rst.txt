Before publishing
=================

This part of the documentation describes the steps that need to be done before publishing a project from QGIS 
on Gisquick platform.
It is also assumed that the user has a project with the required layers
ready in QGIS and wants to publish it. 
To learn more about creating projects in QGIS, see official QGIS documentation at https://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html.

.. _creating-account:

Creating Gisquick account
-------------------------

First of all, a new user account has to be created on a publication
server (for example on Gisquick demo publication server as it is described below).
This can be done by filling in the registration form available at https://demo.gisquick.org/.

   Gisquick login screen.

The user can log in with username and password. After successful
login, Gisquick loads user's profile page which includes a list of already
published projects. After the very first login or in case that user hasn't
published any project yet, only the message appears stating how to proceed.

In order to publish a ``NEW PROJECT`` from QGIS, a QGIS Gisquick plugin must be connected, see chapter below.

    Connect QGIS to GISQUICK.

.. note:: The difference between GISQUICK and GISQUICK (with dbhash) is that the dbhash SQLite version is recommended when working with the Geopackage format.

The plugin is installed but not yet connected to the Gisquick publication server.
To connect to the server, click the icon |plugin-logo| in QGIS toolbar or go to tab ``Web`` - ``Gisquick`` - ``Configure``.

Fill in the Gisquick server URL, username and password. You are now connected
to the publication server and ready to publish projects from QGIS. If the
server URL, username or password is filled in incorrectly, the message **Failed to connect!** is displayed
when you try to connect to Gisquick server (by clicking the icon |logo|).
The information can be corrected right here in the ``Configure`` tab.
