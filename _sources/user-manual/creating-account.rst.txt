Creating account
================

First of all, a new user account must be created on a publication
server (for example on Gisquick demo publication server as it is described below).
This can be done easily by filling the registration form available
at https://projects.gisquick.org/accounts/signup/.

   Gisquick login screen.

The user can log in using credentials (user name and password). After successful
login, Gisquick loads user's welcome page which includes a list of already
published projects. After the very first login or in case that user hasn't
published any project yet, only the message appears stating how to proceed.
